### A Machine Learning Pipeline 

- Research to Production 
- Reproducibility 
- Write production code, including introduction to tests, logging and OOP
- Deploy the model and serve predictions from an API
- Create a Python Package
- Use docker to control software and model versions
- CI/CD


### Steps

- Data collection 
- Data Analysis 
- Data Pre-processing 
- Feature selection 
- Model Building 
- Business evaluation 

We need to deploy the entire steps that will allow us get the data into where the model is located, transform the data field, missing values, and categorical values, and featrue selection to make an prediction.
